**Note**: Assignment2_100584647_CLEANED.zip is a re-upload of my project because the original did not download/open for the TA. I ran `flutter doctor` and `flutter clean` to minimize the size of the project and zipped that up, but it was still too big to be normally uploaded so I had to upload it using git LFS. This may be a reason why the TA was not able to download/open my original zip file. I am unsure of how else to upload my files for assignment 2. If the issue persists, please let me know a way I can submit assignment 2.
